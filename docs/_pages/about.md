I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Analytics (M.S.A.) with a concentration in Data Science and Analytics, focusing on Big Data and Machine Learning, at Georgia State University. This advanced program is equipping me with cutting-edge skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning algorithms.

Previously, I worked as an Assistant System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS), where I focused on SAP S/4 HANA and ABAP development. During my tenure, I optimized SAP reports, improved system efficiency, and implemented automated workflows that significantly enhanced data accessibility and reduced execution time.

Currently, I serve as a Graduate Administrative Assistant at Georgia State University, where I automate tasks, analyze engagement data, and improve student interaction strategies through data-driven decisions.

My passion lies in transforming complex data into actionable insights using Python, SQL, Spark, and machine learning frameworks. I have hands-on experience working on real-world projects in predictive modeling, risk classification, and spatial-temporal crime forecasting.

In addition to technical work, Iâ€™m also deeply interested in writing blogs to share insights from my projects and academic learning. I'm always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals to collaborate and grow together.
